## #Part A. Plan 

Esther and Soul are rommates, and Esther has a dog named Mika. Since Esther is busy throughout the day, she sometimes forgets to fill food or water for Mika. Mika has to wait for a long time until Esther realizes that, especially when Esther is not home. She sometimes asks Soul to check Mika’s bowls and add food/water if needed, but Soul also forgets to do so sometimes and Esther would feel bad for having to ask Soul explicitly all the time and would not do so.

With this device named Doggolight placed in the living space, Esther can easily notice whether food or water needs to be refilled without having to bend down and check Mika’s bowls regularly. This lighting device is activated by the weights of the connected bowls. When it drops below 50g, it will notify the humans by emitting bright-colored lights: Blue for water refill only, orange for food refill only, and red for both.

The light will automatically turn off when the bowls are filled, which saves Esther and Soul time and effort. They don’t need to manually check if the bowls are empty anymore. Instead, they can tell through the light if any bowl needs to be refilled. The light will be noticeable enough given the brightness and the special color choices that will hardly be used in daily lives.

The interaction will happen in the dog owner’s(Esther’s) living space, where the dog(Mika) normally eats and drinks. It will be in the middle of the day when the dog owner’s usually caught up with some busy work or has to be away from home. Primarily, the dog owner and the dog are the main players in this interaction. However, anyone who’s sharing the space with the owner(roommate, visitor, colleague) can be involved. In our scenario, the dog owner is forgetting to refill the dog’s food/water/both. The dog keeps going to her bowls to see if there is water/food. The owner makes the dog more upset by walking past the bowls without noticing them being empty. But now with Doggolight, the owner can easily tell if either bowl is empty so that the dog doesn't have to wait for a long time. Her goals are to walk past the bowls, and then notice the light, and then go do the refilling. She immediately refills the bowls. Doggo happy. She’s happy. The light will be turned off automatically after the refill.

**Feedback**

 - "Having a non-verbal nudge to remind the dog owner to feed and take care of the dog sounds helpful. The location of the light in the room might be important so it cannot be missed by the humans but also not disturbing the space too much. You could add a beeping sound when the bowl was not filled after n-minutes of blinking." -- Michelle Wang
 - "For different dog sizes, it will be great to set the lower bound for the weight of each bowl as dogs with different sizes eat/drink different amounts of food/water. " -- Scarlett Zhang

## #Part B. Act out the Interaction


As in one of the feedbacks, where the device is located is really important. We tried with many different places but were worried that it would not be that noticeable. We first tried to stick the device on the wall where the bowls are located, but it could also be ignored when we acted it out. So we chose to put it on a higher side table next to the bowls.

  

Also, we planned to use the smart lamp at the beginning, but the lamp was hard to costume while we had a better idea of how the device would look like. So eventually we decided to use the phone that can be costumed to how we think the device should look like.

  

We initially planned for two scenarios, one for food only and one for water only. I chose to act out the interaction when I woke up in the morning as food would be usually eaten up by every morning, and I realized that water was out as well. Under such circumstances, a decision needed to be made regarding which color to show first if both are out, and a sequence needed to be performed as well if I add food/water one after the other. To simplify everything, we decided to add another color to the device, which is red when both need to be refilled.


## #Part C. Prototype the device


Unfortunately, we were unable to make Tinkerbelle on our phones. We got the python file to run successfully on our laptop with the port number, but we could never get connected to the port on our phones following the instructions. Therefore to save time, we decided to use another way to show different colors.


## #Part D. Wizard the device
The biggest part of the setup is to prepare for the three scenarios. Therefore we need to empty out the bowl(s) that need to be empty during each scenario before starting to take each piece of the video.

Also, we also need to make Mika (the dog) sniff around the empty bowl so that we can start with this piece indicating that the device would really help with reminding people of adding food/water.


## #Part E. Costume the device

Below is the sketch of what Doggolight might look like:
![Image of Costume Sketch](https://github.com/XinningF/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/Device%20Costume.png?raw=true)

We intended the device to have a look that could intuitively imply it has something to do with the pet. So even the first-time users can go check the dog when they notice the lighting. We went with the rounded bone shape which is simple yet has enough space in the middle for a lighting panel, and a good weight-balance. This cute shape could also arouse some sympathy to go take care of the dog as soon as possible. So we took a cardboard and cut in into the shape of a bone, then cut a rectangle out of the cardboard that has the same size as the phone:

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

To summarize, there are three points made in the feedback we got:
1. Location of where the device should be put could be changed so that the device could be more noticeable.
2. Light notification sometimes could be hard to notice, especially when it is daytime or other light sources are on. Hence, sound notification was mentioned in some feedback.
3. If the pet finishes the food within a short period of time and if the light for food refill is on right after the food is finished, the pet could possibly be overfed.

## Make it your own

To address the three points mentioned in the previous section, we made the following improvements to our Doggolight device:

- We placed the device at multiple locations so it is easier to be noticed by the user.
    
    The placement of the device can be personalized. In our case, we considered the occasions when it’s easy to forget about feeding the pet. So we put one on the desk where the user tends to work by, one on the door for when the user is leaving without refilling the water/food. On top of those two places, we also considered usability, so we placed one near the water dispenser where the user gets water for himself/herself. Below are the images of where the devices are at in our prototype:
    ![Part 2 desk](https://github.com/XinningF/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/Part2%20-%20desk.png)
    ![Part 2 door](https://github.com/XinningF/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/Part2%20-%20door.png)
    ![Part 2 kitchen](https://github.com/XinningF/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/Part2%20-%20kitchen.png)

- We added a sound notification that will be triggered once every 10 min when it’s not in the “Do Not Disturb” period from 12am to 7am. 
		  
    We got three feedback suggesting some additional auditory notification on top of the lighting. There were some concerns about the light being not so noticeable in the living space especially when there are other light sources on. So we added a sound notification to the device while keeping the light feature. Instead of a beeping sound, we added a voice notification for three different scenarios that correspond to the three colors the light will emit: “Please add water”, “Please add food” and “Please add food and water”. Specifying the instruction can prevent the user from having to check the color of the light or the emptiness of the bowl again after hearing the sound. 
    
    Also, considering that the sound notification might be annoying when the user is asleep at night, we set a "Do Not Disturb" period. Within the period, no sound notification will be played. Instead, lights will be the only means of notification.
     
- We added a feature that takes the feeding intervals into account. Once the food is added, the sensor for the food bowl will sleep for 6 hours in case the pet finishes the food right away to ensure that the pet is not overfed.
    
    This is also from one of the feedback we got mentioning the overfeeding problem in case the pet finishes the food in a really short amount of time. To prevent this from happening, we added a feature to the device that will have the food bowl sensor sleep for a certain amount of time, in our case 6 hours before detecting if the food bowl is empty the next time so that if the sound and the light for adding food is triggered, users could add food without worrying that their pets eat too much.
    
With the above improvements, we came up with the updated storyboard:
![Link to the part 2 storyboard](https://github.com/XinningF/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/Part%202%20-%20storyboard.jpeg)

[Link to the part 2 video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gWxkqxKGhHm_DhX-s7iESYY7CTBW16Ts/view?usp=sharing)

While we kept the same costume for the device we had for part 1, we added new features to the original design of the device. We staged the new interaction with the added sound notification, and with multiple locations of the device.

These updates in the design also affected our way of video-taking. We had to record nine separate videos for the three locations and for each color of the light. 

We also made some changes to the layout of the video. We showed the status of the bowls (food empty, water empty, both empty) before each scenario, and with the help of the sound notification, we used fewer subtitles that could be disturbing. Moreover, we added some explanation at the end of the video to show that we have the feeding interval feature and the Do-not-disturb mode.
