## #Part A. Plan 

Esther and Soul are rommates, and Esther has a dog named Mika. Since Esther is busy throughout the day, she sometimes forgets to fill food or water for Mika. Mika has to wait for a long time until Esther realizes that, especially when Esther is not home. She sometimes asks Soul to check Mika’s bowls and add food/water if needed, but Soul also forgets to do so sometimes and Esther would feel bad for having to ask Soul explicitly all the time and would not do so.

With this device named Doggolight placed in the living space, Esther can easily notice whether food or water needs to be refilled without having to bend down and check Mika’s bowls regularly. This lighting device is activated by the weights of the connected bowls. When it drops below 50g, it will notify the humans by emitting bright-colored lights: Blue for water refill only, orange for food refill only, and red for both.

The light will automatically turn off when the bowls are filled, which saves Esther and Soul time and effort. They don’t need to manually check if the bowls are empty anymore. Instead, they can tell through the light if any bowl needs to be refilled. The light will be noticeable enough given the brightness and the special color choices that will hardly be used in daily lives.

The interaction will happen in the dog owner’s(Esther’s) living space, where the dog(Mika) normally eats and drinks. It will be in the middle of the day when the dog owner’s usually caught up with some busy work or has to be away from home. Primarily, the dog owner and the dog are the main players in this interaction. However, anyone who’s sharing the space with the owner(roommate, visitor, colleague) can be involved. In our scenario, the dog owner is forgetting to refill the dog’s food/water/both. The dog keeps going to her bowls to see if there is water/food. The owner makes the dog more upset by walking past the bowls without noticing them being empty. But now with Doggolight, the owner can easily tell if either bowl is empty so that the dog doesn't have to wait for a long time. Her goals are to walk past the bowls, and then notice the light, and then go do the refilling. She immediately refills the bowls. Doggo happy. She’s happy. The light will be turned off automatically after the refill.

**Feedback**

 - "Having a non-verbal nudge to remind the dog owner to feed and take care of the dog sounds helpful. The location of the light in the room might be important so it cannot be missed by the humans but also not disturbing the space too much. You could add a beeping sound when the bowl was not filled after n-minutes of blinking." -- Michelle Wang
 - "For different dog sizes, it will be great to set the lower bound for the weight of each bowl as dogs with different sizes eat/drink different amounts of food/water. " -- Scarlett Zhang

## #Part B. Act out the Interaction


As in one of the feedbacks, where the device is located is really important. We tried with many different places but were worried that it would not be that noticeable. We first tried to stick the device on the wall where the bowls are located, but it could also be ignored when we acted it out. So we chose to put it on a higher side table next to the bowls.

  

Also, we planned to use the smart lamp at the beginning, but the lamp was hard to costume while we had a better idea of how the device would look like. So eventually we decided to use the phone that can be costumed to how we think the device should look like.

  

We initially planned for two scenarios, one for food only and one for water only. I chose to act out the interaction when I woke up in the morning as food would be usually eaten up by every morning, and I realized that water was out as well. Under such circumstances, a decision needed to be made regarding which color to show first if both are out, and a sequence needed to be performed as well if I add food/water one after the other. To simplify everything, we decided to add another color to the device, which is red when both need to be refilled.


## #Part C. Prototype the device


Unfortunately, we were unable to make Tinkerbelle on our phones. We got the python file to run successfully on our laptop with the port number, but we could never get connected to the port on our phones following the instructions. Therefore to save time, we decided to use another way to show different colors.


## #Part D. Wizard the device
The biggest part of the setup is to prepare for the three scenarios. Therefore we need to empty out the bowl(s) that need to be empty during each scenario before starting to take each piece of the video.

Also, we also need to make Mika (the dog) sniff around the empty bowl so that we can start with this piece indicating that the device would really help with reminding people of adding food/water.


## #Part E. Costume the device

Below is the sketch of what Doggolight might look like:

We intended the device to have a look that could intuitively imply it has something to do with the pet. So even the first-time users can go check the dog when they notice the lighting. We went with the rounded bone shape which is simple yet has enough space in the middle for a lighting panel, and a good weight-balance. This cute shape could also arouse some sympathy to go take care of the dog as soon as possible. So we took a cardboard and cut in into the shape of a bone, then cut a rectangle out of the cardboard that has the same size as the phone:

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
